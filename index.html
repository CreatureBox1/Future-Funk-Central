            <h3>What Is Future Funk?</h3>
            <p>
                Future funk is an upbeat genre reminiscent of French house music. 
                It combines elements of funk, disco, and electronic music to create a sound that feels both nostalgic and modern. 
                This style often involves sampling and reinterpreting classic tracks from the 70s and 80s, adding energetic rhythms, funky basslines, and edited vocals. 
                Originating as a subgenre of vaporwave, which is slower and more distorted with heavy sampling, future funk has evolved into its own distinct sound.
                Overall, future funk is a genre that aims to capture the lost romance and emotions of dance music from the past.
