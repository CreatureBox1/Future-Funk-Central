Other Info:
This website offers a database for all songs and artists related to the Future Funk music genre.
You can browse the database, searching for either specific song names or artists.
You may also submit or remove songs from the database.

There are extra pages not related to the database to explore as well.
This includes:
1.The community links page, which provides links to label sites, discord servers, youtube channels, and even future funk informative sites.
2.The playlist page, offering you places to listen to Future Funk. You may either visit the site where the playlist is located or listen within the site.
3.The radios page, which includes radios I frequently listen to. You may also listen to music through the radio player as well.
